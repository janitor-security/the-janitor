### P1-1: Governor-Sealed Decision Receipts

**Class:** Enterprise Audit Evidence

**Observation:**
The bounce log now binds policy hash, threat-intel receipt, transparency anchor,
and PQC signatures, but the evidence is still assembled client-side across
multiple fields. Regulated buyers still lack a single countersigned receipt that
proves the exact policy, intel snapshot, binary version, and decision outcome as
one immutable object.

**Proposal:**
Have `janitor-gov` emit a countersigned `DecisionReceipt` envelope that seals
`policy_hash`, `wisdom_hash`, `commit_sha`, `repo_slug`, `slop_score`,
transparency anchor, and CBOM signature digests under a Governor-controlled
attestation key. Store that receipt in bounce logs, CBOM metadata, and offline
verification output.

**Security impact:**
Eliminates evidentiary recomposition gaps and gives auditors a single
non-repudiable artifact for every enforcement decision.

**Implementation path:**
Define a receipt schema in `common`, sign it in `crates/gov`, embed it in
`BounceLogEntry` and CycloneDX metadata, and extend `verify-cbom` with receipt
verification against the Governor public key.

## P2 — Architecture / Ergonomics

### P2-2: Grammar Stress Fuzzer

**Class:** Defensive Hardening / Fuzzing
**Inspired by:** Parse-budget exhaustion risk and AST bomb classes

**Observation:**
The engine now has deep-scan retry logic, but there is still no systematic
corpus generation for grammar-specific worst-case parse behavior.

**Proposal:**
Build nightly fuzz targets per grammar that record timeout-inducing inputs into
Crucible fixtures for permanent regression coverage.

**Security impact:**
Turns parser-exhaustion failures into harvested adversarial corpora before
attackers can weaponize them in CI.

**Implementation path:**
Add `crates/fuzz` targets and promote timeout reproducers into
`crates/crucible/fixtures/exhaustion/`.

### P2-3: Release Surface Parity Gate

**Class:** Defensive Hardening
**Inspired by:** `justfile` and release command drift across operator surfaces

**Observation:**
Documented release entrypoints can silently diverge from the actual linearized
execution graph. The `v9.5.1` burn incident exposed a failure mode where
unstaged-worktree reasoning published a tag for the previous `HEAD` rather than
the staged payload.

**Proposal:**
Add a release-surface parity test that asserts all documented entrypoints resolve
to the same `audit → fast-release` path, and prove the emitted commit/tag pair
contains the audited payload.

**Security impact:**
Preserves symmetric-failure semantics while preventing redundant release work
from masking regressions.

**Implementation path:**
Add a shell regression in `tools/tests/` that parses `justfile`,
`.agent_governance/commands/release.md` for consistency. Add a second regression
that stages a synthetic change, runs the recipe in fixture mode, and asserts a
new commit is created before tag emission.

### P2-4: Filename-Aware Surface Routing Spine

**Class:** Core Engine Plumbing
**Inspired by:** Extensionless security surfaces in P0-1 execution

**Observation:**
Semantic routing still keys off file extensions alone. High-value build and
control-plane files (`Dockerfile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `BUILD`, `BUILD.bazel`,
`WORKSPACE`, `MODULE.bazel`) carry semantics via canonical filename, not suffix.

**Proposal:**
Introduce a `SurfaceKind` classifier in `common` that resolves from
`Path + shebang + diff metadata` to a stable semantic target. Thread it through
`PatchBouncer`, `bounce_git`, `slop_hunter`, and the MCP response envelope.

**Security impact:**
Eliminates silent coverage gaps on extensionless build files and creates a single
authoritative routing layer for size limits, parser budgets, and domain policy.

**Implementation path:**
Add `crates/common/src/surface.rs` with `SurfaceKind` classification helpers;
replace `extract_patch_ext()` string returns; update MCP serialization.
