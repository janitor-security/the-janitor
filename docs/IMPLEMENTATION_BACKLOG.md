## 2026-04-04 — Codex Alignment & Git Hygiene (v9.2.2)

**Directive:** Enforce tracked-only release commits, ignore local agent state,
resynchronize to the mandatory response format law, and cut `v9.2.2`.

**Files modified:**
- `justfile` *(modified)* — `fast-release` now uses `git commit -a -S -m "chore: release v{{version}}"` behind a dirty-tree guard, preventing untracked local files from being staged during releases
- `.gitignore` *(modified)* — explicit ignore rules added for `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, and other local tool-state directories
- `Cargo.toml` *(modified)* — workspace version bumped to `9.2.2`
- `docs/INNOVATION_LOG.md` *(modified)* — CT-006 logged for the release hygiene regression; session telemetry section appended
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` *(modified)* — this entry

**Commit:** `pending release commit`

## 2026-04-03 — Codex Initialization & Redundancy Purge (v9.2.1)

**Directive:** Align Codex to UAP governance, audit release execution paths for redundant compute, record legacy-governance drift proposals, and cut the `9.2.1` release.

**Files modified:**
- `justfile` *(modified)* — `release` recipe collapsed into a thin `audit` → `fast-release` delegator so agentic deploys follow the single-audit path without duplicated release logic
- `Cargo.toml` *(modified)* — workspace version bumped to `9.2.1`
- `docs/architecture.md` *(modified)* — stale `just release` pipeline description corrected to the linear `audit` → `fast-release` flow
- `docs/INNOVATION_LOG.md` *(modified)* — `Legacy Governance Gaps (P2)` section appended with governance-drift proposals; session telemetry recorded
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` *(modified)* — this entry

**Commit:** `pending release commit`

## 2026-04-03 — Forward-Looking Telemetry (v9.0.2)

**Directive:** Add `just fast-release` recipe (audit-free release path); harden
Evolution Tracker with Forward-Looking Mandate and Architectural Radar Mandate;
purge completed-work entry CT-003 from Innovation Log.

**Files modified:**
- `justfile` *(modified)* — `fast-release version` recipe added; identical to
  `release` but without the `audit` prerequisite
- `.claude/commands/release.md` *(modified)* — Step 4 updated from `just release`
  to `just fast-release`
- `.claude/skills/evolution-tracker/SKILL.md` *(modified)* — Forward-Looking
  Mandate added (no completed work in Innovation Log); Architectural Radar
  Mandate added (4 scanning categories for future R&D proposals)
- `docs/INNOVATION_LOG.md` *(modified)* — CT-003 purged (completed work,
  belongs in Backlog); CT-004 and CT-005 filed as forward-looking proposals
- `Cargo.toml` *(modified)* — version bumped to `9.0.2`

**Commit:** `ff42274`

in Evolution Tracker; build weekly CISA KEV autonomous sync workflow; execute
the first CISO Pulse Audit — re-tier `INNOVATION_LOG.md` into P0/P1/P2 with
12 new grammar depth rule proposals (Go ×3, Rust ×3, Java ×3, Python ×3).

**Files modified:**
- `.claude/rules/response-format.md` *(created)* — Mandatory 4-section
  response format law: [EXECUTION STATUS], [CHANGES COMMITTED], [TELEMETRY],
  [NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION]
- `.claude/skills/evolution-tracker/SKILL.md` *(modified)* — Logic 5 added:
  CT-10 CISO Pulse Audit trigger with full P0/P1/P2 re-tiering protocol
- `.github/workflows/cisa-kev-sync.yml` *(created)* — Weekly CISA KEV JSON
  sync (every Monday 00:00 UTC); diffs against `.janitor/cisa_kev_ids.txt`;
  auto-opens PR with updated snapshot + AST gate checklist
- `docs/INNOVATION_LOG.md` *(rewritten)* — CISO Pulse Audit: full P0/P1/P2
  re-tiering; 12 new grammar depth rules; IDEA-004 (HSM/KMS) added; CT-007
  (update-wisdom --ci-mode gap) and CT-008 (C/C++ AST zero-coverage) filed
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` *(modified)* — this entry
- `Cargo.toml` *(modified)* — version bumped to `9.1.1`

**Purged sections:** CT-005 (`[COMPLETED — v9.1.0]`) merged into the CISO
Pulse log restructure. VULN-02 section was already purged in v9.1.0.

**Commit:** `5056576`

## 2026-04-03 — Wisdom & Java Consolidation (v9.1.2)

**Directive:** Harden CISO Pulse with CT counter reset rule; fix CT-007 by
adding `--ci-mode` to `update-wisdom`; update CISA KEV sync workflow to use
the janitor binary as sole arbiter; execute P0 Java AST depth — implement
Java-1 (readObject KevCritical + test suppression), Java-2 (ProcessBuilder
injection), and Java-3 (XXE DocumentBuilderFactory); add Crucible fixtures.

  added: CT counter resets to CT-001 after every CISO Pulse Audit (epoch reset)
- `crates/cli/src/main.rs` *(modified)* — `--ci-mode` flag added to
  `UpdateWisdom` subcommand; `cmd_update_wisdom` fetches CISA KEV JSON and
  emits `.janitor/wisdom_manifest.json` when `ci_mode = true`
- `crates/forge/src/slop_hunter.rs` *(modified)* — `find_java_danger_invocations`
  gains `inside_test: bool` param + `@Test` annotation suppression;

  TP/TN and DocumentBuilder XXE TP/TN
- `.github/workflows/cisa-kev-sync.yml` *(modified)* — switched from raw `curl`
  to `janitor update-wisdom --ci-mode`; workflow downloads janitor binary from
  GH releases before running
- `docs/INNOVATION_LOG.md` *(modified)* — Java-1/2/3 grammar depth section
  marked `[COMPLETED — v9.1.2]`; CT epoch reset to Epoch 2 (CT-001, CT-002)

env var; broadcast zero-upload proof to enterprise SIEM dashboards; harden
`[NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION]` against recency bias.

**Files modified:**
- `justfile` *(modified)* — both `release` and `fast-release` recipes gain
  `JANITOR_GPG_PASSPHRASE` env var block: if set, pipes to
  `gpg-preset-passphrase --preset EA20B816F8A1750EB737C4E776AE1CBD050A171E`
  before `git tag -s`; falls back to existing cache if unset
- `crates/cli/src/report.rs` *(modified)* — `fire_webhook_if_configured` doc
  comment gains explicit provenance call-out: `provenance.source_bytes_processed`
  and `provenance.egress_bytes_sent` always present in JSON payload for SIEM
  zero-upload dashboards (Datadog/Splunk)
- `.claude/rules/response-format.md` *(modified)* — Anti-Recency-Bias Law added
  to `[NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION]`: must scan entire Innovation Log P0/P1/P2;
  select highest commercial TEI or critical compliance upgrade; recency is not
  a selection criterion
- `RUNBOOK.md` *(modified)* — Section 3 RELEASE: `JANITOR_GPG_PASSPHRASE`
  export documented with key fingerprint, keygrip, and fallback to `gpg-unlock`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` *(modified)* — this entry

fixtures; resolve CT-003 by making `gpg-preset-passphrase` path portable.

**Files modified:**
- `crates/forge/src/slop_hunter.rs` *(modified)* — `GO_MARKERS` pre-filter
  extended with 5 DB method patterns; `find_go_danger_nodes` gains Go-3 gate:
  `call_expression` with field in `{Query,Exec,QueryRow,QueryContext,ExecContext}`
  fires `security:sql_injection_concatenation` (KevCritical) when first arg is
  `binary_expression{+}` with at least one non-literal operand; 3 unit tests added
- `crates/crucible/src/main.rs` *(modified)* — 2 Go-3 fixtures: TP (dynamic
  concat in `db.Query`) + TN (parameterized `db.Query`); Crucible 141/141 → 143/143
- `justfile` *(modified)* — CT-003 resolved: `gpg-preset-passphrase` path now
  resolved via `command -v` + `find` fallback across Debian/Fedora/Arch/macOS;
  no-op if binary not found anywhere (falls back to `gpg-unlock` cache)
- `docs/INNOVATION_LOG.md` *(modified)* — Go-3 marked `[COMPLETED — v9.1.4]`;
  CT-003 section purged (auto-purge: all findings completed)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` *(modified)* — this entry
