the prior tag, autonomously execute `P0-1` by expanding the executable-surface
detectors across six high-risk file types, prove them in Crucible, and record
new architecture debt discovered during implementation.

## 2026-04-03 — SIEM Integration & Autonomous Signing Update (v9.1.3)

**Directive:** Eliminate manual GPG intervention via `JANITOR_GPG_PASSPHRASE`
env var; broadcast zero-upload proof to enterprise SIEM dashboards; harden
`[NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION]` against recency bias.

**Files modified:**
- `justfile` *(modified)* — both `release` and `fast-release` recipes gain
  `JANITOR_GPG_PASSPHRASE` env var block: if set, pipes to
  `gpg-preset-passphrase --preset EA20B816F8A1750EB737C4E776AE1CBD050A171E`
  before `git tag -s`; falls back to existing cache if unset
- `crates/cli/src/report.rs` *(modified)* — `fire_webhook_if_configured` doc
  comment gains explicit provenance call-out: `provenance.source_bytes_processed`
  and `provenance.egress_bytes_sent` always present in JSON payload for SIEM
  zero-upload dashboards (Datadog/Splunk)
- `.claude/rules/response-format.md` *(modified)* — Anti-Recency-Bias Law added
  to `[NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION]`: must scan entire Innovation Log P0/P1/P2;
  select highest commercial TEI or critical compliance upgrade; recency is not
  a selection criterion
- `RUNBOOK.md` *(modified)* — Section 3 RELEASE: `JANITOR_GPG_PASSPHRASE`
  export documented with key fingerprint, keygrip, and fallback to `gpg-unlock`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` *(modified)* — this entry
- `Cargo.toml` *(modified)* — version bumped to `9.1.3`

## 2026-04-03 — Go SQLi Interceptor & Portability Fix (v9.1.4)

**Directive:** Execute P0 Go-3 SQL injection AST gate; add Crucible TP/TN
fixtures; resolve CT-003 by making `gpg-preset-passphrase` path portable.

**Files modified:**
- `crates/forge/src/slop_hunter.rs` *(modified)* — `GO_MARKERS` pre-filter
  extended with 5 DB method patterns; `find_go_danger_nodes` gains Go-3 gate:
  `call_expression` with field in `{Query,Exec,QueryRow,QueryContext,ExecContext}`
  fires `security:sql_injection_concatenation` (KevCritical) when first arg is
  `binary_expression{+}` with at least one non-literal operand; 3 unit tests added
- `crates/crucible/src/main.rs` *(modified)* — 2 Go-3 fixtures: TP (dynamic
  concat in `db.Query`) + TN (parameterized `db.Query`); Crucible 141/141 → 143/143
- `justfile` *(modified)* — CT-003 resolved: `gpg-preset-passphrase` path now
  resolved via `command -v` + `find` fallback across Debian/Fedora/Arch/macOS;
  no-op if binary not found anywhere (falls back to `gpg-unlock` cache)
- `docs/INNOVATION_LOG.md` *(modified)* — Go-3 marked `[COMPLETED — v9.1.4]`;
  CT-003 section purged (auto-purge: all findings completed)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` *(modified)* — this entry
- `Cargo.toml` *(modified)* — version bumped to `9.1.4`

  `new XMLDecoder(stream)` `object_creation_expression` gate (KevCritical,
  CVE-2017-10271, CVE-2019-2725); 3 new unit tests
- `crates/crucible/src/main.rs` *(modified)* — 3 new fixtures: ctx.resolve TP/TN,
  XMLDecoder TP; Crucible 141/141 → 144/144

**Directive:** Fix release pipeline to include `.agent_governance/` in `git add`; complete P0-1 parse-forest reuse by migrating all high-redundancy AST-heavy detectors to `ParsedUnit::ensure_tree()`

**Files modified:**
- `justfile` *(modified)* — `fast-release` recipe: `git add` now includes `.agent_governance/` directory so governance rule changes enter the release commit
- `crates/forge/src/slop_hunter.rs` *(modified)* — 11 AST-heavy detectors migrated from `(eng, source: &[u8])` to `(eng, parsed: &ParsedUnit<'_>)` using `ensure_tree()`: `find_js_slop`, `find_python_sqli_slop`, `find_python_ssrf_slop`, `find_python_path_traversal_slop`, `find_java_slop`, `find_js_sqli_slop`, `find_js_ssrf_slop`, `find_js_path_traversal_slop`, `find_csharp_slop`, `find_prototype_merge_sink_slop`, `find_jsx_dangerous_html_slop`; 4 `#[cfg(test)]` byte-wrappers added; 3 test module aliases updated; `find_slop` call sites updated to pass `parsed`
- `SOVEREIGN_BRIEFING.md` *(modified)* — `find_slop` signature updated to `(lang, &ParsedUnit)` with P0-1 parse-forest note; stale `(lang, source)` reference corrected

  CT numbering and 10-count pulse workflow; direct P0/P1/P2 triage is now the
  mandatory background rule
- `.agent_governance/rules/response-format.md` *(modified)* — final summary
  telemetry language aligned to direct triage; next action now requires an
  explicit TAM / TEI justification

  `fast-release`
- `crates/common/src/lib.rs` *(modified)* — registered `scm` module
