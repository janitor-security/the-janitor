**Directive:** Enforce tracked-only release commits, ignore local agent state,
resynchronize to the mandatory response format law, and cut `v9.2.2`.

**Files modified:**

  `gpg-preset-passphrase --preset EA20B816F8A1750EB737C4E776AE1CBD050A171E`
  before `git tag -s`; falls back to existing cache if unset
- `crates/cli/src/report.rs` *(modified)* — `fire_webhook_if_configured` doc
  comment gains explicit provenance call-out: `provenance.source_bytes_processed`
  and `provenance.egress_bytes_sent` always present in JSON payload for SIEM
  zero-upload dashboards (Datadog/Splunk)
- `.claude/rules/response-format.md` *(modified)* — Anti-Recency-Bias Law added
  to `[NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION]`: must scan entire Innovation Log P0/P1/P2;
  select highest commercial TEI or critical compliance upgrade; recency is not
  a selection criterion
- `RUNBOOK.md` *(modified)* — Section 3 RELEASE: `JANITOR_GPG_PASSPHRASE`
  export documented with key fingerprint, keygrip, and fallback to `gpg-unlock`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` *(modified)* — this entry

**Files modified:**
- `crates/forge/src/slop_hunter.rs` *(modified)* — `GO_MARKERS` pre-filter
  extended with 5 DB method patterns; `find_go_danger_nodes` gains Go-3 gate:
  `call_expression` with field in `{Query,Exec,QueryRow,QueryContext,ExecContext}`

  `binary_expression{+}` with at least one non-literal operand; 3 unit tests added
- `crates/crucible/src/main.rs` *(modified)* — 2 Go-3 fixtures: TP (dynamic
  concat in `db.Query`) + TN (parameterized `db.Query`); Crucible 141/141 → 143/143
- `justfile` *(modified)* — CT-003 resolved: `gpg-preset-passphrase` path now
  resolved via `command -v` + `find` fallback across Debian/Fedora/Arch/macOS;
  no-op if binary not found anywhere (falls back to `gpg-unlock` cache)

  CT-003 section purged (auto-purge: all findings completed)
